PHP map tile engine
===

# About #
This map tile engine was created using PHP and MySQL (with spatial data types) for use with the Google Maps API. Spatial data is loaded in via [.shp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) and [.dbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) files.

# Demo #
Here is a demo of the map tile engine in action. I have only drawn the world boundaries.
